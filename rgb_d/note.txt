0. Use VGG/ ResNEt / EfficientNet / ConvNext instead of patch embedding
1. Implement a Decoder to take the trained ID-JEPA output embeddings to reconstruct Depth
2. Train and Test everything with Grayscale image imput instead of RGB 
3. If Grayscale is similar to RGB, can i use the same Patch Embedding
